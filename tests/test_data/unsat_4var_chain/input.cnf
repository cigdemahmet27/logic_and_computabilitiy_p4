c UNSAT 4-variable formula with propagation chain
c This demonstrates unit propagation leading to conflict
c
c C1: (-4)             - forces 4=FALSE
c C2: (4 OR 1)         - with 4=FALSE, forces 1=TRUE
c C3: (-1 OR 2)        - with 1=TRUE, forces 2=TRUE
c C4: (-2 OR 3)        - with 2=TRUE, forces 3=TRUE
c C5: (-3)             - forces 3=FALSE -> CONFLICT with C4!
c
c Propagation chain at DL 0:
c   -4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> CONFLICT (C5 requires -3)
