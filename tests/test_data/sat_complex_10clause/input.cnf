c Complex SAT test case with 6 variables, 12 clauses
c Requires multiple decision levels with conflicts and backtracking
c
c Formula designed to:
c - Have multiple decision levels (at least DL0-DL4)
c - Cause conflicts at DL2 and DL3 requiring backtracking
c - Eventually find SAT solution
c
c Expected execution path:
c DL0: No unit clauses
c DL1: Decide x1 -> propagation
c DL2: Decide x2 -> CONFLICT -> backtrack -> try opposite
c DL3: Decide x3 -> CONFLICT -> backtrack -> try opposite  
c DL4: Decide x4 -> propagation -> SAT
c
c Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
c
c Clauses designed for complex interaction:
c C1:  (1 OR 2 OR 3)         - needs at least one of 1,2,3
c C2:  (-1 OR 4)             - if 1=T, then 4=T
c C3:  (-2 OR 5)             - if 2=T, then 5=T
c C4:  (-3 OR 6)             - if 3=T, then 6=T
c C5:  (-4 OR -5)            - can't have both 4=T and 5=T
c C6:  (-4 OR -6)            - can't have both 4=T and 6=T
c C7:  (-5 OR -6)            - can't have both 5=T and 6=T
c C8:  (1 OR -2)             - 1=T or 2=F
c C9:  (-1 OR 2 OR 6)        - complex dependency
c C10: (3 OR 4 OR 5)         - needs one of 3,4,5
c C11: (-3 OR -4 OR 5)       - constraint on 3,4,5
c C12: (2 OR -5 OR 6)        - another dependency
c
c Solution path: 1=T, 2=F, 3=F, 4=T, 5=F, 6=T
