                         Test: unsat_conflict
                    Formula: (1) AND (-1 OR 2) AND (-2)
================================================================================

--- DECISION LEVEL 0 ---
STATUS: CONFLICT
Unit propagation leads to immediate conflict.

[DL0] UNIT        L=1   | C1 (1) - unit clause
[DL0] ASSIGN      L=1   |
[DL0] SATISFIED         | C1
[DL0] UNIT        L=2   | C2 (-1 OR 2) - -1 is FALSE (1=TRUE), forces 2
[DL0] ASSIGN      L=2   |
[DL0] SATISFIED         | C2
[DL0] CONFLICT          | C3 (-2) violated - 2 is TRUE but C3 requires -2
[DL0] BACKTRACK         | No previous decision level to backtrack to!

--- CURRENT VARIABLE STATE (DL 0) ---
1    | TRUE
2    | TRUE

                              FINAL RESULT
================================================================================
RESULT: UNSATISFIABLE
MODEL: None
DECISION LEVELS EXPLORED: 1 (DL 0 only)
BACKTRACKS: 0 (No decisions to undo - conflict at DL 0 means UNSAT)
REASON: Initial BCP at DL 0 creates unsolvable contradiction
