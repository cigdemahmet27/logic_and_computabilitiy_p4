c UNSAT after DL2 test case
c Formula: (1 OR 2) AND (-1 OR 3) AND (-2 OR -3) AND (-1 OR -2) AND (1 OR -2) AND (2 OR 3)
c
c This formula is UNSAT but requires exploration:
c DL0: No unit clauses, CONTINUE
c DL1: Decide 1=TRUE 
c      C2 propagates 3=TRUE
c      C3 becomes (-2 OR FALSE) -> forces -2
c      C4 satisfied (-1 OR -2), C1 satisfied, C5 satisfied, C6 satisfied
c      Wait, that's SAT... let me redesign
c
c New formula - definitely UNSAT:
c C1: (1 OR 2)
c C2: (-1 OR -2)  
c C3: (1 OR -2)
c C4: (-1 OR 2)
c
c Analysis: Pairwise contradictions
c - If 1=TRUE: C2 requires -2 (2=FALSE), but C4 requires 2=TRUE -> CONFLICT
c - If 1=FALSE: C3 requires -2 (2=FALSE), but C1 requires 2=TRUE -> CONFLICT
